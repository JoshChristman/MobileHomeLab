## üîß Proxmox
In this mobile home lab setup,Proxmox is used as the hypervisor to manage virtual machines and containers, providing a flexible and powerful virtualization platform. Proxmox allows for efficient resource allocation and centralized management, making it easy to deploy and maintain multiple VMs in a compact environment. In this setup, Proxmox hosts an OpenWRT VM that acts as the main router, managing network traffic, firewall rules, and DHCP settings. It also runs an Ubuntu Server VM with Docker, which serves as a container host for additional services, including a Tailscale container for secure remote access. This configuration allows for testing networking setups, running isolated applications in containers, and maintaining secure connectivity to the lab from remote locations. Proxmox‚Äôs web-based interface streamlines the process of creating, configuring, and monitoring these VMs, making it an ideal choice for a versatile and easily managed home lab environment.

## üåê OpenWRT
In this mobile lab, OpenWRT serves as the primary router, providing advanced networking features and robust control over network traffic. Running as a virtual machine on Proxmox, OpenWRT leverages NIC passthrough to access two physical Intel i226-V network interfaces directly: one designated for WAN and the other for LAN. This setup enables high-speed wired connectivity and flexibility in managing network flows between local and external networks. Additionally, OpenWRT is configured to use two USB interfaces: one for a USB Wi-Fi dongle, allowing the lab to connect to external networks wirelessly, and the other for USB tethering from a mobile phone for WAN data access. This combination of direct NIC passthrough and USB-based network options makes it easy to switch between wired, wireless, or tethered WAN connections as needed, providing a versatile and highly adaptable network environment ideal for testing various scenarios and maintaining reliable internet access in the lab.

## üñ•Ô∏è Ubuntu Linux Server
In this lab, Ubuntu Server plays a central role, hosting key services and applications for testing and development. Running as a virtual machine on Proxmox, Ubuntu Server is configured with Cockpit, an intuitive web-based GUI that simplifies server management tasks such as monitoring, updating, and configuring the system directly from a browser. To ensure dedicated access and control, a single NIC is passed through as an admin interface, providing a backup connection specifically for administrative tasks. Additionally, the 4TB SATA SSD is passed through to the Ubuntu VM, creating a substantial storage pool ideal for data backup, application storage, and Docker containers. With this setup, Docker containers have direct access to the large storage pool, allowing for efficient use of space and performance when running multiple services. This configuration combines powerful local storage and easy web-based management, making Ubuntu Server a reliable and scalable solution for home lab projects.

## üê≥ Docker
In this home lab setup, Docker serves as a flexible and lightweight platform for managing and running containers. To streamline container management, Portainer is installed, providing a user-friendly web GUI for deploying, monitoring, and maintaining containers. With Portainer, you can easily manage containerized applications, networks, and volumes from a single interface. One core application in this lab is Dashy, a customizable home lab dashboard that centralizes access to all lab services, links, and tools, making it easy to monitor and navigate the environment. Another key container is Syncthing, which is configured to sync specific folders between my home NAS and the lab environment. This setup ensures that important files are always up to date across devices, with changes automatically mirrored between systems. Together, Docker, Portainer, Dashy, and Syncthing create a powerful ecosystem for efficient management, access, and data synchronization, ideal for keeping lab resources organized and readily available.
