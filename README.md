<h2>Description</h2>
This project documents a powerful, portable home lab setup using the N100 model as the hardware foundation. Designed for flexible, on-the-go network and server experimentation, the lab supports advanced routing, containerization, and secure remote access. Key components include OpenWRT as a virtualized router, Ubuntu Server with Docker, and a Tailscale VPN container, enabling a robust network testing and development environment.

<h2>Hardware</h2>
The mobile home lab is built on the versatile N100 model, optimized for networking and scalability. It features a quad Intel i226-V 2.5G LAN setup, providing four high-speed RJ45 ports that enable advanced networking configurations and multi-device connectivity. The device includes 2 USB 3.0 ports, 4 USB 2.0 ports, and an RJ45 COM console for flexible connectivity options. Memory and storage are robust, with a 32GB DDR5 SODIMM RAM slot running at 4800MHz and dual storage optionsâ€”a Crucial P3 1TB NVMe M.2 SSD and a 4TB SATA SSD for significant performance and capacity. A MediaTek MT7921 Wi-Fi card, replacing the original Intel AX210, offers AP (Access Point) capabilities, expanding wireless options, while external Wi-Fi antennas boost signal strength for broader connectivity. This hardware configuration forms a powerful, compact lab environment ideal for advanced networking, virtualization, and portable testing applications.
